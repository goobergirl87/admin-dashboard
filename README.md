# admin-dashboard

The admin dashboard is the last project of the intermediate HTML/CSS chapter in the full stack java script path of The Odin Project. The goal is to build a dashboard mainly with grid. The exercise included a file that should be used to get an idea of what to build. 

Since I'm planning to build a website/ an app about learning crafts with a ux-friend of mine, I created a dashboard that takes up that idea.
